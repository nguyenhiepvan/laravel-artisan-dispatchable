This package can register jobs as Artisan commands. All you need to do is let your job implement the empty `ArtisanDispatchable` interface.

```php
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Spatie\ArtisanDispatchable\Jobs\ArtisanDispatchable;

class ProcessPodcast implements ShouldQueue, ArtisanDispatchable
{
    public function handle()
    {
        // perform some work...
    }
}
```

This allows the job to be executed via Artisan. 

```bash
php artisan process-podcast
```

## Why we created this package

[Laravel's scheduler](https://laravel.com/docs/master/scheduling#introduction) will perform all tasks sequentially.  When you add a scheduled task to the scheduler, the task should perform its work as fast as possible, so no other tasks will have to wait.

If you have a task that needs to run every minute and its runtime is close to a minute, you should not use a simple Artisan command, as this will result in the delay of all other minute-ly tasks.

Long-running tasks should be performed by jobs that perform their work on the queue. Laravel has [the ability to schedule queued jobs](https://laravel.com/docs/master/scheduling#scheduling-queued-jobs). This way, those tasks will not block the scheduler.

```php
$schedule->job(new ProcessPodcast)->everyFiveMinutes();
````

The downside of this approach is that you cannot run that job via Artisan anymore. You have to choose between using an artisan command + blocking the scheduler on the one hand, and job + not blocking the scheduler on the other hand.

Using our package, you don't have to make that choice anymore. When letting your job implement `Spatie\ArtisanDispatchable\Jobs\ArtisanDispatchable`, you will not block the scheduler and can still execute the logic via Artisan.

We invest a lot of resources into creating [best in class open source packages](https://spatie.be/open-source). You can support us by [buying one of our paid products](https://spatie.be/open-source/support-us).

We highly appreciate you sending us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using. You'll find our address on [our contact page](https://spatie.be/about-us). We publish all received postcards on [our virtual postcard wall](https://spatie.be/open-source/postcards).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require nguyenhiep/laravel-artisan-dispatchable
```

Optionally, you can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\ArtisanDispatchable\ArtisanDispatchableServiceProvider" --tag="artisan-dispatchable-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
    /*
     * These directories will be scanned for dispatchable jobs. They
     * will be registered automatically to Artisan.
     */
    'auto_discover_dispatchable_jobs' => [
        app()->path(),
    ],

    /*
     * This directory will be used as the base path when scanning
     * for dispatchable jobs.
     */
    'auto_discover_base_path' => base_path(),

    /*
     * In production, you likely don't want the package to auto-discover dispatchable
     * jobs every time Artisan is invoked. The package can cache discovered job.
     *
     * Here you can specify where the cache should be stored.
     */
    'cache_file' => storage_path('app/artisan-dispatchable/artisan-dispatchable-jobs.php'),

    /**
     * Here you can specify the prefix to be used for all dispatchable jobs.
     */
    'command_name_prefix' => '',
];
```

## Usage

All you need to do is let your job implement the empty `ArtisanDispatchable` interface.

```php
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Spatie\ArtisanDispatchable\Jobs\ArtisanDispatchable;

class ProcessPodcast implements ShouldQueue, ArtisanDispatchable
{
    public function handle()
    {
        // perform some work...
    }
}
```

This allows the job to be executed via Artisan.

```bash
php artisan process-podcast
```

This job will not be queued, but will be immediately executed inside the executed artisan command. 

### Queueing jobs via Artisan

If you want to put your job on the queue instead of executing it immediately, add the `queued` option.

```bash
php artisan process-podcast --queued
```

### Passing arguments to a job

If your job has constructor arguments, you may pass those arguments via options on the artisan command.

```php
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Spatie\ArtisanDispatchable\Jobs\ArtisanDispatchable;


class ProcessPodcast implements ShouldQueue, ArtisanDispatchable
{
    public function __construct(
        string $myFirstArgument, 
    ) {}

    public function handle()
    {
        // perform some work...
    }
}
```

Via artisan, you can call the job like this

```bash
php artisan process-podcast --my-first-argument="My string value"
```

### Using Eloquent models as arguments

If your job argument is an eloquent model, you may pass the id of the model to the artisan command option. 

```php
use App\Models\Podcast;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Spatie\ArtisanDispatchable\Jobs\ArtisanDispatchable;

class ProcessPodcast implements ShouldQueue, ArtisanDispatchable
{
    public function __construct(
        Podcast $podcast, 
    ) {}

    public function handle()
    {
        // perform some work...
    }
}
```

Here's how you can execute this job with podcast id `1234`

```bash
php artisan process-podcast --podcast="1234"
```

### Customizing the name of the command

By default, the artisan command name of a job, is the base name of job in kebab-case.

You can set a custom name by setting a property named `artisanName` on your job.

```php
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Spatie\ArtisanDispatchable\Jobs\ArtisanDispatchable;

class ProcessPodcast implements ShouldQueue, ArtisanDispatchable
{
     public string $artisanName = 'my-app:process-my-podcast';

    public function handle()
    {
        // perform some work...
    }
}
```

This job can now be executed with this command:

```bash
php artisan my-app:process-my-podcast
```

### Customizing the description of the command

To add a description to the list of artisan commands, add a property `$artisanDescription` to your job.

```php
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Spatie\ArtisanDispatchable\Jobs\ArtisanDispatchable;

class ProcessPodcast implements ShouldQueue, ArtisanDispatchable
{
    public string $artisanDescription = 'This a custom description';

    public function handle()
    {
        // perform some work...
    }
}
```

### Prefixing all commands

You can specify a prefix in the `command_name_prefix` key of the config file. When this is for example set to `my-custom-prefix`, then you would be able to call `MyDispatchableJob` with this command:

```bash 
php artisan my-custom-prefix:process-my-podcast
```

### Caching discovered jobs

This package can automatically discover jobs that implement `ArtisanDispatchable` and what their artisan command should be through looping through all classes and performing some reflection. In a local environment this is perfect, as the performance hit is not too bad, and you don't have to do anything special besides letting your job implement `ArtisanDispatchable`.

In a production environment, you probably don't want to loop through all classes on every request. The package contains a command to cache all discovered jobs.

```bash
php artisan artisan-dispatchable:cache-artisan-dispatchable-jobs
```

You probably want to call that command during your deployment of your app. This will create cache file at the location specified in the `cache_file` key of the `artisan-dispatchable` config file.

Should you want to clear the cache, you can execute this command:

```bash
php artisan artisan-dispatchable:clear-artisan-dispatchable-jobs
```
